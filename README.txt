LOL no one ever reads the Documentation. get outta here!

Ok I actually had the time to put in a tiny amount of effort

from chapter 12 I really only used for each, 

Chapter 13 was more usefull, mostly from inheritance and all that plus I over rode toString() a few times. 
though I kinda went out of my way to make things somewhat silo'd

I should play with lambda functions more they seem very cool I just dont want to spend the time right now

Chapter 14 I grabbed polymorphism and made a couple classes, DVD and VHS just as a proof of concept and called them from Movie

Made Manager abstract while I was at it.

I couldnt find a need for enums or doing wierd thing with CONSTANTS 

I did get multipul inheritance though, thats how I hid some things like add and remove movie oblects from the array list to just Manager
and made them private as well

Hell I was using Protected and stuff last semester


IDK but I actaully had fun with this, hell I even put data validation in it this time. 

PS. ya, i know there is a ton of things that are implimented in Movie that I never call like sort by actor Z to A and  stuff.
